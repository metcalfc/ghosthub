# Terminal configuration

Ghosthub embeds libghostty for terminal rendering. It does not embed or run
Ghostty.app, and Ghostty.app is not a runtime dependency.

## Configuration file

Ghosthub's terminal configuration lives at:

```text
~/.config/ghosthub/ghostty.conf
```

The file uses [Ghostty's configuration format](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference),
but it is owned and loaded independently by Ghosthub. Global Ghostty.app
configuration does not affect Ghosthub.

Ghosthub reloads terminal configuration after the file changes. Use
++shift+cmd+comma++ to request a reload immediately.

## Terminal themes

Ghostty's built-in color schemes ship with Ghosthub, so `theme` accepts any of
their names directly:

```text
theme = Catppuccin Macchiato
```

Conditional light and dark themes, and paths to your own theme files, work the
same way.

## Shell startup

For local shells, Ghosthub preserves libghostty's normal macOS login-shell and
shell-integration behavior. It does not force a custom shell command by
default. Your ordinary zsh startup files and key bindings should load as they
do in a native macOS terminal.

Ghosthub avoids inheriting launcher-terminal `EDITOR` and `VISUAL` values that
can unexpectedly change zsh keymaps. It sets `TERM_PROGRAM` to `ghosthub`.

## Tmux themes

The **Tmux Theme** picker in Settings supplies colors for new sessions created
by Ghosthub. When **Follow ghostty.conf** is selected, the effective foreground
and background follow the current light or dark appearance.

Existing tmux sessions keep their own appearance by default. This avoids
silently repainting a shared session for every attached client.

To change the active connected session once, choose **Session → Apply Theme to
Current Session** or the matching Command Palette action. It updates the
session's existing windows and tmux chrome for all attached clients.

To style future attachments to shared sessions automatically, enable **Apply
theme to shared tmux sessions** in Settings. This is an explicit opt-in.

Theme application is not available for the Console Panel or native Windows
sessions.

## Clipboard behavior

Remote tmux copy mode can copy text to the Mac clipboard through OSC 52. Paste
uses the configured terminal shortcut and libghostty's safe paste path.

## Quit behavior

**Confirm before quitting Ghosthub** is enabled by default under
**Settings → Terminal**. Quitting the app or closing its windows detaches from
tmux and leaves sessions running.
