# Terminal Sessions

Terminal behavior is the highest-risk part of Ghosthub. The app must behave
like a normal macOS terminal while remaining isolated from Ghostty.app
configuration and launcher-terminal environment.

## Product Boundary

Ghosthub is a native session switcher for tmux servers across the local Mac
and configured SSH hosts. There are two inventory sources:

- **kwt workspaces:** projects, worktrees, and registered plain directories
  read from kwt's supported JSON commands, including each workspace's exact
  `session_name`.
- **unbound sessions:** every other session returned by direct `tmux
  list-sessions` discovery on the host.

Both open through the same ordinary tmux client in one libghostty surface. A
session created by Middleman is visible when it exists on the host tmux server,
but Ghosthub does not consult Middleman to identify, create, attach, mutate, or
destroy it.

Ghosthub may also create one ordinary session when the user explicitly chooses
New Tmux Session for a host. This is not a separate managed-session type: the
result immediately joins the same direct tmux inventory and has the same
detach-only presentation lifecycle as every other session.

## Native Tmux Attachment

Ghosthub invokes `tmux attach-session -E -t =<name>` for a local session. A
remote POSIX session uses the same tmux command through OpenSSH. An
experimental native Windows host invokes psmux's `tmux.exe` compatibility
alias through an encoded Windows PowerShell command and the same exact session
target. There is no
`tmux -CC`, pane capture, history replay, silent rendering child, Swift pane
map, split-tree projection, or Ghosthub tab bar. Tmux owns:

- windows, panes, layout, focus, and status-line presentation
- terminal history and alternate-screen state
- pane processes and session lifetime
- tmux-native key bindings and mouse behavior

Ghosthub owns inventory presentation, terminal clients, and connection state.
Each workspace window retains every presentation it explicitly opens, keyed by
the exact host, tmux socket, and session name. Navigating to another host,
worktree, or session removes the previous surface from the visible hierarchy
and marks it occluded without freeing the surface or terminating its tmux/SSH
client. Returning to it reuses the same handle and surface. Cmd-W or a
pane-originated close request detaches only the active presentation; closing a
workspace window or quitting Ghosthub detaches every presentation owned by
that window and never destroys server-side state. The separate Kill Session
action is the only destructive lifecycle operation.
It is offered only when direct discovery or a currently connected active
attachment establishes that the session is running. Before displaying
confirmation, Ghosthub captures tmux's server PID, `session_id`, and
`session_created` values together with the exact local or SSH endpoint, socket,
and session name. Termination uses one tmux conditional command that compares
all three live identity values and invokes `kill-session -t =<name>:` only on
a match. The server PID distinguishes tmux server generations, while the
monotonically assigned session ID distinguishes same-named replacements within
one server even when their second-resolution creation timestamps match. A
replacement session is therefore never killed under stale cached inventory or
a disconnected attachment. Ghosthub detaches an active client only after that
command succeeds, so a failed lookup, SSH connection, identity check, or kill
leaves the presentation open. After success it rechecks the active attachment,
closing that exact current selection and navigating away only if it is the
killed target.

Ghosthub applies the selected Tmux Theme when it creates a new bare tmux
session. A built-in palette pins its configured colors onto the session's
panes. Follow ghostty.conf pins nothing: the panes already render in the
terminal's own colors for the current macOS appearance, including conditional
light and dark themes, so Ghosthub applies only its session chrome. Pinning
resolved colors there would hand tmux an exact color it may be unable to
render, and a tmux client without RGB support repaints the pane in the nearest
256-color approximation — visibly changing a pane that was already correct.
Existing sessions retain their own appearance by default: Ghosthub neither
places a client-local palette over them nor changes their tmux options.

Users may enable the persistent shared-session override. On each future
attachment, that override resets the exact session's `status-style`,
`message-style`, and `message-command-style` to terminal-default colors, and a
built-in palette also sets each existing window's default foreground and
background. Both are applied within the attach command itself; kwt-backed
workspaces style after kwt's own client attaches. Follow ghostty.conf sets no
window colors, so it needs nothing from the surface and enumerates no windows.
**Session -> Apply Theme to Current Session** and the
matching command-palette action apply the selected effective style immediately
to the connected active workspace tmux attachment without changing the
persistent preference or reconnecting. Console Panel terminals are not tmux
session targets. Both paths change shared tmux options, so every attached client
sees the result. These best-effort style commands do not change tmux interaction:
prefix and key tables, mouse behavior, windows, panes, history, and layout
remain untouched.
Native Windows attachment leaves psmux's status and message styles user-owned;
psmux does not preserve tmux's session-scoped rendering for these style resets
and may apply `reverse` across the client rather than only its status line. The
persistent override and one-shot action are therefore unavailable for native
Windows sessions.

## Relaunch Restoration

Quitting Ghosthub or installing an update only drops disposable clients. When
macOS restores workspace scenes, Ghosthub resolves each scene's stable logical
descriptor against current inventory and uses attach-only restoration; it
never creates a missing session or falls back to a same-named target on a
different host or socket. Worktree identity is the durable generation reported
by kwt, so removing and recreating a worktree at the same path cannot inherit a
saved presentation; a missing generation restores only as far as the project.
A directory workspace instead restores by its registered path on the same
stable host, because the kwt registry has no separate generation for it.
Once a worktree presentation has observed a generation, incomplete inventory
cannot erase it and a different non-nil generation is treated as a replacement;
explicitly reselecting the worktree invalidates the observed presentation and
attaches the replacement session.
For **Install and Relaunch**, Ghosthub also writes a one-shot ordered window
manifest under `~/.ghosthub/` before Sparkle terminates the app. On the next
launch, Ghosthub collects initial and late native scene values until AppKit
reports that native window restoration has finished and every restored workspace
window has registered its SwiftUI scene. Ghosthub waits for binding quiescence
before unresolved scenes receive provisional unclaimed descriptors, then opens
every saved window still missing. Later native descriptors correct provisional
assignments, including by moving a displaced session to a provisionally opened
replay scene. Replay requests use distinct scene tokens so SwiftUI cannot satisfy
them with a late native saved window, and displaced requests are explicitly
reissued. This covers absent or partial macOS restoration without swapping
sessions between restored geometry or tab groups. The manifest is removed only
after every saved window has begun attach-only restoration in one live assigned
scene; native scene restoration still supplies geometry and tab grouping when
available. Once assigned, the scene model's complete logical descriptor replaces
any delayed same-ID native payload with stale navigation or tmux data.
An ordinary local session must be present in direct discovery before Ghosthub
runs the exact `attach-session` path. Remote sessions use that same rule and,
after a confirmed attachment, Ghosthub's native reconnect supervisor owns any
transport recovery.
Offline or otherwise unavailable targets remain pending and retry when normal
inventory refreshes publish new state. Navigating the window elsewhere cancels
the pending target. If a scene was captured without an active tmux
presentation, Ghosthub restores its host and selected project, worktree, or
directory navigation but does not open or create the workspace session until
the user explicitly selects it.

A protected worktree is distinct from a same-named session on the default tmux
server. Restoration first probes the descriptor's exact host, protected socket,
and session name. Only a successful probe may delegate attachment to `kwt pr
attach`, which remains authoritative for validating and repairing that
workspace before executing the ordinary tmux client. The session can still
disappear between Ghosthub's probe and kwt's command; eliminating that benign
race requires a future atomic kwt attach-only contract. Ghosthub does not use
the default server as a fallback when the probe is absent or fails.

The host-scoped console surface is outside workspace scene restoration and is
reopened by the user. Restoring one session into multiple windows preserves
the same tmux-native shared-presentation behavior that existed before quit;
the broader collision and console policy remains tracked by kata `s75s`.

Explicit local creation uses one atomic `new-session -A` create-or-attach
client invocation. This closes the detached-session race when the user's tmux
server has `destroy-unattached` enabled. Explicit remote creation performs a
one-shot `has-session`/detached `new-session` phase before ordinary attachment.
The remote process then performs one ordinary attachment. If that client later
loses its transport, the native reconnect supervisor can only launch another
attach-only client; it can never rerun creation. The session name is validated
before launch and passed as one shell-quoted argument. If the exact name
already exists, it is attached without creating or structurally changing panes
or windows.

Kwt inventory includes every worktree and registered directory, whether or not
its canonical tmux session is live. When the managed helper is available,
Ghosthub therefore
executes `kwt open <exact-path>` as the initial attached tmux client. Kwt
idempotently repairs an existing session or creates the configured layout when
it is absent, without an intermediate detached session that
`destroy-unattached` could remove. Ghosthub uses this path even when cached
discovery contains the canonical name, because the session may have exited
since the sample. If the managed helper is explicitly unavailable, a cached
discovered session remains usable through ordinary `tmux attach-session`. On a
remote host, only an SSH transport loss can hand a kwt-opened session to
Ghosthub's native recovery supervisor. Ghosthub first probes the exact session:
confirmed presence advances to ordinary attachment, while confirmed absence
reruns `kwt open` only if the interrupted establishment was never confirmed.
Once attachment is confirmed, every later recovery remains attach-only. On
POSIX hosts, every remote tmux phase (creation,
attachment, open, and probe, styled or not) runs through the account login
shell so settings such as `TMUX_TMPDIR` resolve the same tmux server as later
styling and identity commands. On Windows, those phases use encoded
PowerShell commands within the same OpenSSH account environment. Unbound
discovered sessions remain attach-only.
Ghosthub does not expose rename, resize, or window operations. On an attached
tmux terminal, Cmd-D and Cmd-Shift-D request Ghostty-style split-right and
split-down operations; the File menu exposes the same actions and shortcuts.
These actions require tmux 3.4 or newer; Ghosthub checks the binary on each
local or remote attachment and leaves normal tmux key bindings available on
older versions. On supported POSIX hosts, Ghosthub runs `split-window -h` or
`split-window -v` against the active pane of that attachment's exact host and
socket using its frozen SSH route. Once the client attaches, it publishes its
TTY and stable tmux server and session identity under that attachment's unique
token. Each split atomically finds and validates that exact client, then
targets the session's active pane.
Other clients attaching
at the same time cannot be mistaken for the Ghosthub surface. Renaming the
attached session therefore keeps splits working, while a same-named replacement
or a client switched to another session is rejected. Failed client discovery is
not cached, and each queued request receives its own attempt. Ghosthub
serializes requests for the attachment. The keyboard
shortcuts apply only while the terminal has effective keyboard focus and no
sheet is attached; choosing either File menu item remains an explicit request.
The action works regardless of the user's tmux prefix or key-table bindings
while tmux remains authoritative for pane creation and layout. If tmux rejects
a split, Ghosthub displays its diagnostic over the attachment. Native Windows
psmux attachments do not offer pane-split actions or intercept these shortcuts.
Kill Session is exposed separately from presentation only for a session known
to be running and always requires confirmation.

Native Windows creation also supplies the SSH account's process `PATH` through
psmux's `new-session -e` contract. Psmux otherwise starts detached panes
without the user-level path entries visible to Windows OpenSSH, which prevents
tools installed under locations such as `.local\bin`, WinGet links, or the npm
prefix from resolving. This applies only while creating a session; attachment
does not modify an existing session or running pane.

The requested session appears optimistically so transient SSH or discovery
latency cannot remove the user's only way back to it. Direct `list-sessions`
reconciliation begins only after the terminal runtime accepts the creation
command and uses bounded backoff. The optimistic entry remains while that
command is alive; authoritative absence retires it only after retries are
exhausted and the command has ended. Once confirmed, the active presentation
and all later retries are demoted to attach-only. Pending probes are scoped to
the resolved host endpoint and cancelled when that endpoint changes or the
owning window shuts down.

Before discovery or attachment, Ghosthub resolves an absolute tmux-compatible
binary path. POSIX hosts require tmux 3.2 or newer; the experimental Windows
path accepts psmux's tmux 3.2 compatibility level. On POSIX hosts the login
shell initializes its environment, then delegates Ghosthub's probe to
`/bin/sh`; fish and other non-POSIX account shells never interpret the POSIX
probe itself. On Windows, Ghosthub starts noninteractive Windows PowerShell
and resolves `tmux.exe` with `Get-Command`.
Successful paths are cached per frozen host connection; lookup and version
failures remain retryable and are presented to the user.

## SSH Keepalive and Reconnect

Remote clients use the user's OpenSSH configuration and add server keepalives.
If OpenSSH requires interactive authentication, Ghosthub shows its challenge
in a native secure-entry sheet and passes the session-only response through a
private FIFO. Later inventory and tmux clients reuse that app-session control
connection and remain noninteractive. Every control connection is named for
one app launch and supervised by a parent-held descriptor that stays open for
the app lifetime, so an app crash terminates the SSH master and a later launch
cannot reuse its socket.
Remote attachment and establishment shell commands are one-shot: they contain
no retry timing and never print reconnect status into the terminal buffer.
The local wrapper around each complete remote command records its final status
in an app-owned, per-attachment temporary file before it exits. The native
coordinator consumes that status instead of relying on libghostty's outer macOS
login process, whose reported status may be zero even when nested OpenSSH
exited 255.
After a confirmed attachment exits with OpenSSH's transport/setup status 255,
that retained presentation's native supervisor probes the real SSH and tmux
path at attempt-start intervals of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and then 30 seconds. Each
probe has a 15-second end-to-end deadline; its runtime counts against the
interval, and an overrun clamps the next delay to zero. Attempts never overlap.
**Reconnect Now** wakes
the same supervisor immediately instead of starting a parallel path.

Default-socket recovery shares the host's in-flight `list-sessions` probe with
inventory discovery. Protected sockets use a headless
`tmux -L <socket> has-session -t =<name>` probe so an unsuccessful attempt never
creates or flashes a terminal surface. Confirmed presence launches one new
attach-only client. Confirmed absence ends a default-socket or protected-socket
presentation only when that exact session had already been established; an
unconfirmed interrupted kwt establishment may rerun its one-shot creation path.
A reachable non-transport tmux failure is presented as unable to attach rather
than retried indefinitely. A clean detach does not start recovery.

Transport failures continue retrying automatically, with no more than 30
seconds between attempt starts, even while their retained presentation is
inactive. Authentication and host-key review failures pause that presentation's
automatic retry and appear in the existing native recovery flow when it is
active. Successful recovery resumes the same supervisor. If SSH is already
reachable when that flow checks again, **Retry** resumes the supervisor as well
as refreshing host inventory. Only the recovery flow opened for that tmux
request may resume it; authentication started from ordinary host inventory
never reopens a session. Dismissing it leaves an honest
**Connection needs attention** presentation with **Review Connection** when
native review is available; reopening that review retains the active recovery
request and can resume its supervisor after success. **Host Settings** remains
the fallback otherwise. A changed known-host
identity still requires the explicit known-hosts remediation described by that
flow; Ghosthub never silently accepts it.

A direct connection's OpenSSH `LocalCommand` writes a private marker after
transport and authentication succeed. Host verification emits a marker only
after the remote command begins. Status 255 and local wrapper failures such as
an unconfirmed timeout leave the host offline; a nonzero login-shell or
probe-command status is reachable and degraded only when that marker proves the
remote account executed the probe.

The initial psmux path allocates an ordinary SSH PTY and targets Windows 11
build 22523 or newer. Older ConPTY builds preserve keyboard input but consume
psmux mouse-reporting sequences; supporting them would require the separate
psmux `ssh -T` wrapper and is not part of this experiment.

Tmux remains alive on the remote host while the network is unavailable. After
connectivity returns, the client reattaches to the same exact session and tmux
renders its authoritative state. Copy-mode and programs on configured remote
hosts may write the Mac clipboard through OSC 52 when allowed by the user's
`clipboard-write` configuration, so remote tmux copy behaves like local tmux
copy. Remote terminal surfaces cannot read the local Mac clipboard through
OSC 52, regardless of `clipboard-read`. libghostty exposes the semantic type
of every clipboard request: Ghosthub supplies clipboard contents only for a
configured `paste_from_clipboard` action, independent of which key triggers
it. libghostty retains bracketed-paste framing and requires confirmation before
unsafe unbracketed text can reach the PTY.

## Inventory and Startup

At startup Ghosthub loads kwt project/worktree inventory and tmux session
inventory for every resolvable host. The initial content view remains in an
explicit loading state until kwt returns, so the empty onboarding state never
flashes before existing workspaces are known. That loaded empty state is
informational: kwt owns project registration, and Ghosthub does not expose a
retired repository-intake path as a nonfunctional substitute.

Inventory degrades per host. An unavailable remote host retains its cached
inventory and exposes a clickable detail warning on that host without blocking
the rest of the workspace. The detail offers a retry and a shortcut to Host
Settings; OpenSSH status 255 is reported as an SSH connection failure instead
of a login-shell or tmux failure. Remote hosts where Ghosthub's managed kwt is
absent remain available for direct tmux discovery and attachment. Before kwt
inventory runs for a configured macOS or Linux host, Ghosthub ensures its exact
revisioned helper is installed under the remote user's `~/.ghosthub/`
directory. A provisioning failure is reported for that host and disables its
worktree actions without blocking tmux inventory. On macOS and Linux, a fresh
helper has an empty project registry: **Add Project** in the host's **+** menu
passes one user-supplied absolute checkout path to kwt's noninteractive
registration command, then refreshes inventory. Immediately before
registration, Ghosthub re-resolves the host ID and rejects the operation if its
endpoint changed while Add Project was open. No filesystem scan occurs.

On experimental Windows hosts, an explicit Install Bundled kwt action probes
the process architecture, uploads the matching pinned AMD64 or ARM64 helper,
verifies its SHA-256 and exact revision, and activates it at
`%USERPROFILE%\.ghosthub\helpers\kwt\<revision>\kwt.exe`. Inventory and
workspace operations use only that exact per-user helper and never resolve
`kwt.exe` from `PATH`.
Project registration is not yet supported on Windows, so its Add Project
actions are hidden. Inventory never installs or updates the unsigned Windows
helper automatically.

Direct tmux discovery marks a default-server worktree session as running when
its exact kwt session name is present and the host remains reachable. Cached
inventory does not preserve the live indicator through a discovery failure.
Kwt session names are removed from the generic session group by default and
remain rendered under their project/worktree. Settings → Worktrees can expose
those duplicate generic session entries. Every remaining tmux session is
eligible for the host-level session group. Case-sensitive `*` and `?` wildcard
patterns in
`hidden_session_patterns` under `[tmux]` inside
`~/.config/ghosthub/config.toml` hide matching standalone sessions from the
sidebar and command palette. Settings → Worktrees edits the same list, one
pattern per line. Filtering occurs after discovery and never suppresses a kwt
worktree, its running state, duplicate-name checks, or session identity.

Tmux activity indicators do not extend inventory polling. Once an ordinary
client has connected during the current app launch, Ghosthub samples only that
exact session as a warm target. Active warm sessions are sampled every five
seconds, quiet targets every twenty seconds, and unavailable targets back off
to thirty seconds. Each probe captures at most the active pane's latest 160
scrollback lines, excluding its visible screen, and computes a checksum on the
local or remote host without discarding trailing blank output, so terminal
text is not returned to Ghosthub. The fingerprint also carries the pane's
scrollback line count so blank or repeated output records progression until
the pane's history limit is reached. Once history is full, output that leaves
the bounded tail byte-identical reads as quiet: tmux exposes no cumulative
output counter, and its activity timestamps also advance on redraws, so this
keeps the deliberate bias toward quiet false negatives over misleading
attention signals.
The probe verifies the expected server PID, session ID, and creation time on
the host before any capture runs, targets the scrollback and capture reads at
the exact pane ID from that verified read, and re-evaluates the identity
predicate inside the same tmux server dispatch as each read, so a same-named
replacement session is never read even when it races the probe. Identity,
pane, and pane-dimension reads before and after the capture must also match.
Native Windows sampling verifies at runtime that psmux supports the format
predicate and if-shell contract, then uses the same atomic reads; when the
capability probe fails, the sample is refused rather than taken without the
predicate. The first sample after a pane switch, a pane resize, or a sampling gap
longer than the activity window establishes a quiet baseline; later
scrollback progression on that pane at unchanged dimensions marks the session
active for thirty seconds. Sample continuity is measured from each probe's
start, so a slow probe on a laggy host cannot stretch the gap past the window
and demote real changes to baselines. In-place prompt,
spinner, and status redraws do not count as activity, and neither do client
resizes, which reflow scrollback without representing new work.
Windows activity sampling requires psmux 3.3.4 or newer because earlier
versions do not expose negative scrollback ranges. Older supported psmux
versions remain available for discovery and attachment but publish no passive
activity state.
Closing a presentation does not remove warm state, while app termination,
session disappearance, or identity replacement does. Every host refresh and
every new scene reconciles warm entries against the currently configured
endpoints, so a reconfigured or removed host stops being sampled even when the
change happened while no window observed it. Retiring a warm entry cancels its
in-flight probe; a probe cancelled after its host command launched drains
within the probe's ten-second timeout and its result is discarded. This state
is not saved to the database.

Pull-request imports are the one alternate-socket case. Kwt returns the named
socket reserved for the workspace-specific server, and Ghosthub carries that
identity with the worktree selection. Import does not start tmux or execute a
configured project layout. A successful import without a
nonempty socket identity is rejected as malformed rather than treated as a
default-server session. Ghosthub supplies `-L <socket>` to its best-effort
presentation commands, but launches the client through `kwt pr attach
<workspace-path>`. Kwt verifies provenance and creates or repairs an inert
shell-only protected session before executing `attach-session -E`, including
on every SSH reconnect. Remote reconnects invoke Ghosthub's exact managed kwt
path rather than resolving `kwt` from the login-shell `PATH`. Project commands
run only after the user explicitly invokes them in that shell. Ghosthub never
directly creates or attaches
through the default server for that imported workspace.

## Local PTY

App-owned local PTY surfaces remain only for host-scoped utility surfaces such
as the log viewer while that auxiliary UI exists. They are not the worktree
session model and die with the app process.

## Shell Startup Rules

- Let libghostty launch the user's shell through its normal macOS login-shell
  path unless there is a strong product reason not to.
- Keep `TERM_PROGRAM=ghosthub`.
- Do not leak launcher-terminal `EDITOR` or `VISUAL` into embedded shells.
- Keep Ghosthub terminal config at `~/.config/ghosthub/ghostty.conf`.
- Ship libghostty's emitted `share` tree with every build. The bootstrap emits
  the bundled theme corpus, shell integration, and compiled terminfo; app
  bundles stage `ghostty/` and `terminfo/` into `Contents/Resources`, and
  Ghosthub points `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` at whichever layout it finds.
  Without it `theme = <name>` resolves only against a user's own
  `~/.config/ghostty/themes`.
- Keep the generated base config independent of tmux themes. Built-in Tmux
  Theme colors or libghostty's effective Follow ghostty.conf colors are applied
  at session creation, through the explicit shared-session override, or by the
  active-session command, never as a client-local libghostty overlay.
- Keep mutable Ghosthub app state under `~/.ghosthub/`.
- Do not read or depend on Ghostty.app global config.
- Do not install Ghosthub-owned layout, zoom, or tab management. Native tmux
  owns those interactions. Explicit app shortcuts may request a semantic tmux
  operation against the active attachment, such as pane splitting.
- Do not disable libghostty shell integration to work around keybinding
  bugs.

## Configuration Reloading

Ghosthub automatically watches the complete active terminal-configuration
graph: `~/.config/ghosthub/ghostty.conf`, the selected local project's
`.ghosthub/terminal.conf`, the app-owned appearance overlay, and recursive
`config-file` includes. Missing optional includes and absent project or
appearance files remain watched so creating them triggers a reload. Filesystem
events are debounced before rebuilding the graph.

An imported pull-request workspace is contributor-authored source, so its
`.ghosthub/terminal.conf` is never loaded. Selecting one uses the project's
own checkout instead.

Reloading is transactional. A candidate with diagnostics is rejected and the
last valid libghostty configuration remains active. Successful automatic
reloads are silent; automatic failures remain visible until dismissed or
superseded. Explicit reloads present their result. **Ghosthub → Reload
Configuration**, Quick Launch, and
<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> all provide the explicit path.
Options that libghostty cannot apply to existing surfaces retain their upstream
restart or new-surface semantics.

## Verification

For terminal startup, environment, config layering, libghostty bootstrap, key
handling, or remote terminal changes, run:

```bash
make test-libghostty-bootstrap
make python-test
swift test
make build
```
